project

This is a booking app service for a barbershop. 

UX

This app is easy to use, for an user to login(register) it will only require just a name and a password. As an user you will choose the date, time, what kind of haircut you want, and also some description if you need to add anything else.


Features

The backend runs in python with flask, my database of choise is mongodb where users, admin can add data straight to our database. I use Materialize to customize to front-end and some build in javascript. I also added some icons from fontawesome.

Technologies

Mongo as database, flask our backend framework with python.

Content

Our main content will be our user bookings.

Media

Not a lot of media, just some images for our barbershop.

Acknowledgements

Even though this does all the CRUD operations, it still needs a user profile. Best way to have the bookings is not in table, better in a calendar for an easier use.
